## Interface plugin

The Linux interface plugin is a base plugin managing unix-based host OS interfaces. Currently it only supports interfaces of type vETH and TAP, since these interface types mostly serve as counterparts to VPP interfaces. 

The plugin also watches interface changes but only supported types are considered relevant. The difference between the VPP and Linux interface plugin is that the Linux plugin does not remove any "redundant" (in terms of agent) configuration and leaves it intact. Instead, the plugin holds state of all vETH and TAP interfaces present in the default namespace.

Namespaces are also supported, however they are handled by a different plugin. Interfaces in namespaces other than default remain unknown if not listed in the NB configuration (they are not registered during resync).

The vpp-agent uses external library to fetch data about OS interfaces and manage them.  

The Linux interface model defines following [model][linux-interface-model] describing model with the first part common for all interface types, and the second part specific for every interface type. The interface have an optional namespace field. The interface name is required, and the host name can be specified as well. If not, the host name will 
be the same as the logical name.

### VETH

The VETH (virtual Ethernet) device is a local Ethernet tunnel. Devices are created in pairs. Packets transmitted on one device in the pair are immediately received on the other device. When either device is down, the link state of the pair is down. The VETH configuration when namespaces need to communicate to the main host namespace or between each other.

The VETH interfaces are created after both ends are defined and known to the agent. The single VTEP can be put to the vpp-agent, but it is cached until its counterpart config appears. 

The type-specific configuration is of type `VethLink` and contains a mandatory field `peer_if_name` which is the name of the adjacent VETH end. Optionally, the checksum offloading of the received and transmitted packets can be defined. The VETH interface is in the vpp-agent used as an target for the VPP af-packet interface. 

### TAP

The TAP interface is a virtual network kernel interface which simulates a link-layer device. TAP interfaces are not directly created by the vpp-agent - they are automatically put to the host OD default namespace by the VPP after the VPP TAP interface is created. The [VPP interface plugin model][vpp-interface-model] for TAPs defines a special field used to define the host name of the Linux TAP interface created.
 
After that, the Linux interface can be modified by the linux plugin - IP or MAC address can be set, or the interface can be moved to different namespace.
 
The Linux tap delete means that the interface is reverted to the original state, all configured fields are stripped and it is moved back to default namespace. The interface disappears when its VPP counterpart is removed. 

**Configuration example**

**1. Using the key-value database** put the proto-modelled data with the correct key for Linux interface to the database ([key reference][key-reference]).

Example configuration for VETH. Keep in mind that two interfaces must be defined with correct peer name:

The first VETH:
```json
{  
    "name":"veth1",
    "type":"VETH",
    "namespace":{  
        "type":"NSID",
        "reference":"ns1"
    },
    "enabled":true,
    "ip_addresses":[  
        "192.168.22.1/24",
        "10.0.2.2/24"
    ],
    "phys_address":"D2:74:8C:12:67:D2",
    "mtu":1500,
    "veth":{  
        "peer_if_name":"veth2"
    }
}
```

The second VETH:
```json
{  
    "name":"veth2",
    "type":"VETH",
    "namespace":{  
        "type":"NSID",
        "reference":"ns2"
    },
    "enabled":true,
    "ip_addresses":[  
        "192.168.22.5/24"
    ],
    "phys_address":"92:C7:42:67:AB:CD",
    "mtu":1500,
    "veth":{  
        "peer_if_name":"veth1"
    }
}
```

Tap interface: 
```json
{  
    "name":"tap1",
    "type":"TAP_TO_VPP",
    "namespace":{  
        "type":"NSID",
        "reference":"ns2"
    },
    "host_if_name":"tap-host",
    "enabled":true,
    "ip_addresses":[  
        "172.52.45.127/24"
    ],
    "phys_address":"BC:FE:E9:5E:07:04",
    "mtu":1500,
    "tap":{  
        "vpp_tap_if_name":"tap-host"
    }
}
```

Use `etcdctl` to put both compacted interface key-value entries:
```bash
# VETH1
etcdctl put /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/interfaces/v2/interface/veth1 '{"name":"veth1","type":"VETH","namespace":{"type":"NSID","reference":"ns1"},"enabled":true,"ip_addresses":["192.168.22.1/24","10.0.2.2/24"],"phys_address":"D2:74:8C:12:67:D2","mtu":1500,"veth":{"peer_if_name":"veth2"}}'

# VETH 2
etcdctl put /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/interfaces/v2/interface/veth2 '{"name":"veth2","type":"VETH","namespace":{"type":"NSID","reference":"ns2"},"enabled":true,"ip_addresses":["192.168.22.5/24"],"phys_address":"92:C7:42:67:AB:CD","mtu":1500,"veth":{"peer_if_name":"veth1"}}'

# TAP
etcdctl put /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/interfaces/v2/interface/tap1 '{"name":"tap1","type":"TAP_TO_VPP","namespace":{"type":"NSID","reference":"ns2"},"host_if_name":"tap-host","enabled":true,"ip_addresses":["172.52.45.127/24"],"phys_address":"BC:FE:E9:5E:07:04","mtu":1500,"tap":{"vpp_tap_if_name":"tap-host"}}'
```

**2. Using REST:**

The REST currently supports only retrieval of the existing configuration. The following command can be used to read all Linux interfaces via cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9191/dump/linux/v2/interfaces
```
**3. Using GRPC:**

Prepare the interface data (TAP):
```go
linuxTap := &linuxIf.Interface{
		Name:        "tap1",
		HostIfName:  "tap-host",
		Type:        linuxIf.Interface_TAP_TO_VPP,
		Enabled:     true,
		PhysAddress: "BC:FE:E9:5E:07:04",
		Namespace: &linux_namespace.NetNamespace{
			Reference: "ns2",
			Type:      linux_namespace.NetNamespace_NSID,
		},
		Mtu: 1500,
		IpAddresses: []string{
			"172.52.45.127/24",
		},
		Link: &linuxIf.Interface_Tap{
			Tap: &linuxIf.TapLink{
				VppTapIfName: "tap-host",
			},
		},
	}
```

Prepare the GRPC config data:
```go
import (
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/configurator"
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/models/linux"
)

config := &configurator.Config{
		LinuxConfig: &linux.ConfigData{
			Interfaces: []*interfaces.Interface{
				memoryInterface,
			},
		}
	}
```

The config data can be combined with any other Linux and VPP configuration.

Update the data via the GRPC using the client of the `ConfigurationClient` type (read more about how to prepare the GRPC connection and about other CRUD methods in the [GRPC tutorial][grpc-tutorial]):
```go
import (
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/configurator"
)

response, err := client.Update(context.Background(), &configurator.UpdateRequest{Update: config, FullResync: true})
```

### Limitations

The linux plugin namespace management requires docker ran in the privileged mode (with the `--privileged`) parameter. Otherwise, the vpp-agent can fail to start. 

### Disable the Linux interface plugin

Use the Linux config file for interfaces and for l3 plugin and set `disabled` na `true` (both of them must be disabled).

## L3 plugin

The Linux L3 plugin is capable of configuring **Linux ARP** entries and **Linux routes**. The Linux L3 plugin is dependent on [Linux interface plugin][linux-interface-guide] since both configuration items are dependent on the Linux interface managed by it. L3 configuration items support Linux namespace in the same manner as the Linux interfaces.  

### ARP entries

Linux ARP is a communication protocol which helps to discover a MAC address associated with the given IP address. The plugin makes a use of the very simple proto model with interface, IP address and MAC address fields. All those fields are mandatory.

The namespace resolution is automatic and user does not need to care about it. Since the ARP entry is dependent on the associated Linux interface, the configuration is postponed till the moment the interface appears. Target namespace is derived from the interface identified by the unique name. The interface host name has to be unique within the namespace 
scope.   

The northbound Linux plugin API defines ARP in the following [model][linux-arp-model]. Every ARP entry is defined with MAC address, IP address, and an interface. The IP address and the interface are a part of the key.

In the generated proto model, the ARP is referred to the `ARPEntry` object.

**Configuration example**

**1. Using the key-value database** put the proto-modelled data with the correct key for Linux ARP entries to the database ([key reference][key-reference]).

Example value:
```json
{  
    "interface":"veth1",
    "ip_address":"130.0.0.1",
    "hw_address":"46:06:18:DB:05:3A"
}
```

Use `etcdctl` to put compacted key-value entry:
```bash
etcdctl put /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/l3/v2/arp/veth1/130.0.0.1 '{"interface":"veth1","ip_address":"130.0.0.1","hw_address":"46:06:18:DB:05:3A"}'
```

To remove configuration:
```bash
etcdctl del /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/l3/v2/arp/veth1/130.0.0.1
```

**2. Using REST:**

The REST currently supports only retrieving of the existing configuration. The following command can be used to read all ARP entries via cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9191/dump/linux/v2/arps
```

**3. Using GRPC:**

Prepare the Linux ARP data:
```go
linuxArp := &linuxL3.ARPEntry{
		Interface: "linuxIf1",
		IpAddress: "130.0.0.1",
		HwAddress: "46:06:18:DB:05:3A",
	}
```

Prepare the GRPC config data:
```go
import (
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/configurator"
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/models/linux"
)

config := &configurator.Config{
		LinuxConfig: &linux.ConfigData{
			ArpEntries []*l3.ARPEntry {    
			    linuxArp,
			},	
		}
	}
```

The config data can be combined with any other Linux or VPP configuration.

Update the data via the GRPC using the client of the `ConfigurationClient` type (read more about how to prepare the GRPC connection and about other CRUD methods in the [GRPC tutorial][grpc-tutorial]):
```go
import (
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/configurator"
)

response, err := client.Update(context.Background(), &configurator.UpdateRequest{Update: config, FullResync: true})
```

### Routes

A routing table is a data table listing the routes to particular network destinations and metrics (distances) associated with routes. The route interface is mandatory (the namespace is derived from the interface, the same principle as for the Linux ARP). If source and gateway IP addresses are set, they must be valid and the gateway IP address must be evaluated as reachable. Every route defines a scope, the options are 'Global', 'Site', 'Link' and 'Host'. The scope is also expected to be defined the route config.  

The northbound Linux plugin API defines Route in the following [model][linux-route-model].

**Configuration example**

**1. Using the key-value database** put the proto-modelled data with the correct key for Linux ARP entries to the database ([key reference][key-reference]).

Example configuration:
```json
{  
    "outgoing_interface":"linuxIf1",
    "dst_network":"10.0.2.0/24",
    "metric":100
}
```

Use `etcdctl` to put compacted key-value entry:
```bash
etcdctl put /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/l3/v2/route/10.0.2.0/24/veth1 '{"outgoing_interface":"veth1","dst_network":"10.0.2.0/24","metric":100}'
```

To remove configuration:
```bash
etcdctl del /vnf-agent/vpp1/config/linux/l3/v2/route/10.0.2.0/24/veth1
```

**2. Using REST:**

The REST currently supports only retrieving of the existing configuration. The following command can be used to read all ARP entries via cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9191/dump/linux/v2/routes
```

**3. Using GRPC:**

Prepare the Linux route data:
```go
linuxRoute := &linuxL3.Route{
		DstNetwork:        "10.0.2.0/24",
		OutgoingInterface: "veth1",
		Metric:            100,
		Scope:             linuxL3.Route_HOST,
	}
```

Prepare the GRPC config data:
```go
import (
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/configurator"
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/models/linux"
)

config := &configurator.Config{
		LinuxConfig: &linux.ConfigData{
			Routes: []*l3.Route  {    
			    linuxRoute,
			},	
		}
	}
```

Update the data via the GRPC using the client of the `ConfigurationClient` type (read more about how to prepare the GRPC connection and about other CRUD methods in the [GRPC tutorial][grpc-tutorial]:
```go
import (
	"github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/api/configurator"
)

response, err := client.Update(context.Background(), &configurator.UpdateRequest{Update: config, FullResync: true})
```

## Namespace plugin

The namespace plugin is an auxiliary plugin used mainly by other Linux plugins to handle namespaces and microservices.

The namespace [model][linux-namespace-model] contains two fields - the type, and the reference. The namespace can be of type named, defined by a process ID, referenced by a file handle or as a docker container running some microservice. The reference is a namespace identifier (namespace ID, specific PID, file path or a microservice label).

The namespace is imported in the [Linux interface plugin][linux-interface-guide], by itself does not define any keys (except notifications). 

### Namespaces

The agent has full support for Linux network namespaces. It is possible to attach Linux interface/ARP/route into a new, existing or even yet-to-be-created network namespace via the `Namespace` configuration section inside data model.

Namespace can be referenced in multiple ways. The most low-level link to a namespace is a file descriptor associated with the symbolic link automatically created in the `proc` filesystem, pointing to the definition of the namespace used by a given process (`/proc/<PID>/ns/net`) or by a task of a given process (`/proc/<PID>/task/<TID>/ns/net`). A more 
common approach to reference namespace is to use just the PID of the process whose namespace we want to attach to, or to create a bind-mount of the symbolic link into `/var/run/netns` directory and use the filename of that mount. The latter is called `named` namespace and it is created and managed for example by the `ip netns` command line tool from the `iproute2` package. The advantage of `named` namespace is that it can outlive the process it was originally created by.

A `namespace` configuration section should be seen as a union of values. First, set the type and then store the reference into the appropriate field (`pid` vs. `name` vs `microservice`). The agent supports both PID-based references as well as `named` namespaces.

### Microservices

Additionally, we provide a non-standard namespace reference, denoted as `MICROSERVICE_REF_NS`, which is specific to ecosystems with microservices. It is possible to attach interface/ARP/route into the namespace of a container that runs microservice with a given label. To make it even simpler, it is not required to start the microservice before the 
configured item is pushed. The agent will postpone interface (re)configuration until the referenced microservice gets launched. Behind the scenes, the agent communicates with the docker daemon to construct and maintain an up-to-date map of microservice labels to PIDs and IDs of their corresponding containers. Whenever a new microservice is detected, all 
pending interfaces are moved to its namespace.
